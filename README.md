# font-randomizer
Someone dared me to do this. This has no value.

===============================================

This will randomize the fonts used in Cinnamon (and only Cinnamon by default, Windows version may come later and support for other DEs/WMs can be added by swapping out commands and strings as needed) literally just to piss me and a friend off. Time between changes, etc. are all easily configurable.

Make sure to change the location of the backup of your font settings, as you probably aren't running this on my machine.
